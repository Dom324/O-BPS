Files batage.h and batage.cc implement an 8KB BATAGE predictor tuned for the CBP 2016 traces.

See P. Michaud, "An alternative TAGE-like conditional branch predictor", ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization, 2018.

Explicit BATAGE parameters are hard-coded in batage.h
If you want a different predictor size, you must modify batage.h

Files predictor.h and predictor.cc are for the CBP 2016 simulator (https://www.jilp.org/cbp2016/).
